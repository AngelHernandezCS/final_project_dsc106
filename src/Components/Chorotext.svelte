     Aliens must love Hollywood... from the map we can see that
     California has the most amount of sightings in, 8912 of them, 
     in the United States. A common trend shown is that states located
     near borders/oceans have many more sightings compared to central 
     states. Maybe the aliens care more for the US neighbors and the beach.
     But don't pack your bags just yet! Of the top three states:
     California, Texas, Florida, they have one thing in common,
     <b>They are Huge!</b> atleast compared to the rest of the US.
     Lets take a closer look at the exact locations of these sightings
     and find dense areas.
