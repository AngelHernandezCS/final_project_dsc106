    <br>
    <br>
    As we've discovered, the mideastern part of the United States has the most amount of clustered sightings without 
    being completely dominated by airports and military bases. It's to no surprise the majority of the sightings happend in the afternoon or late at night 
    as that would provide the best visibility of a shining object in the sky. Lastly we looked and examined the most common 
    shapes people have accounted and looked more into the context where we found that a circular fireball shape is the most
    likely to be something that isn't easily explainable.
