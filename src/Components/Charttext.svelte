     The general consensus for the shape seen in the sky is "light, circle, triangle".
     It comes to no surprise that something seen in the night sky has to be bright or 
     it wouldn't have been noticed otherwise. Triangle being the second most common shape
     raises some concerns. The shape of any ariel vehicle very closely resembles a triangle.
     When looking at something very far away in the sky, the clearest notable thing to see is the rough shape.
     Well, the last popular description is a circle. Sighitings were a circluar shape is reported are the most likely 
     to have been real UFO's. Upon further inspection, most comments made that describe a circular shape in the sky
     is accompanied by the word 'fireball'. A circular fireball with eratic movement in the sky definetly speaks
     to be real UFO's.
