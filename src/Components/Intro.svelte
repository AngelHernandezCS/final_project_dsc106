    The universe is vast and full of mysteries. The human race simply cant be the 
    only intellegent beings out there. Is there any solid evidence to say that we
    aren't? No... not yet atleast! Just because we cant find them doesn't mean they
    cant find us. Many people have spotted strange objects in the sky. Is it a sattelite,
    a shuttle, Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster? Whatever they may be people have one thing
    cross their mind first, <b>ALIENS</b>.

    If scientists can't come to any conclusion about what these people have seen
    then maybe it's best to check it out for youself. In this guide we'll explore
    prime locations for sightings, the right times to look at, and what exactly
    you should be looking for in the starry night sky. It might seem like alot
    but dont worry we'll start off with the first step, Location.
