     Peak alien sighting time seems to be between 11PM and 7AM, possibly when 
     random objects might seem more blurry and alien-like against the dark night sky... We can see that 
     any time is a good time to see a UFO on the West Coast, with California taking top UFO sightings for 
     every hour of the day. Perhaps there are more UFO enthusiasts living in the Sunshine state. 
     We notice another trend where Washington slowly increases its number of sightings as the day progresses from 12AM 
     to 11PM. Are the Aliens on a schedule? Who knows! We observe that the numbers
     stay relatively consistent in the midwest and the east coast, with more drastic changes on the west. We presume this is due to the size of the states, maybe also due to more flying activity in general with major cities.
